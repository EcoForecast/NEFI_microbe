The elevation ranges between 1,500-1,700 meters.
Site history & management
CPER includes 6,300 hectares of undulating rangeland. Large herbivores such as cattle (and previously, bison), and burrowing animals such as the black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) play dominant roles in ecosystem function and maintenance. CPER retains most of the features representative of pre-settlement conditions, with large native herbivores. CPER is influenced by contemporary land-use practices, such as agriculture and cattle grazing.

NEON collects a standard suite of data at CPER; however, data collected at this site serves as a benchmark for exploring the causes and consequences of environmental change taking place throughout the grasslands of the Central Plains Domain, with results relevant to arid and semi-arid grassland ecosystems worldwide. Overall, the Front Range of Colorado is growing at 3 times the national average with the population expected to surpass 5.7 million by 2030. Conversion of native vegetation to urban and suburban landscapes drastically alters biological diversity, reduces soil organic matter and alters the temporal and spatial distribution of plant biomass.
Vegetation
The dominant vegetation at CPER is moderately grazed Shortgrass steppe. The biotic communities of the Shortgrass steppe ecosystem are well adapted for drought; other vegetative species include blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) and prickly-pear cactus (Opuntia polyacantha). CPER represents grassland communities across multiple domains and a range of climatic regions.

Before establishment of the no-till cropping systems, the site was under conventional tillage since it was taken from native sod in about 1910. Conventional tillage from 1910 to 1985 ranged from moldboard plowing in the early years to sweep tillage in the later years. The primary crop was winter wheat grown in a wheat-fallow rotation. Proso millet also had been grown occasionally during a few years before 1985. Cropping systems under no-till management were initiated in 1985. These systems included:

Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow
Winter wheat-maize (Zea mays L.)-fallow
Winter wheat-maize-proso millet (Panicum miliaceum L.)-fallow
Continuous cropping (crops grown over the years included maize, sorghum, winter wheat, forage millet, and sunflower)
Perennial grass

Grass stands were established in the spring of 1986 and contain a mixture of perennial species including warm and cool season grasses.
Climate
Summers in Sterling are hot with low humidity and winters are typically around freezing point but can drop to lower temperatures. Occasional hailstorms and thunderstorms are expected during the growing seasons. North Sterling also experiences seasonal high winds and tornados. NEON’s North Sterling site is owned privately and managed by a local farmer; it is subject to the shifting agronomic and economic needs of the area.

Region-wide logging for pine in the late 1800s and early to mid-1900's led to clear-cutting of most forested areas on the property. The main parcel was donated to the University in the 1930s. Timber harvest continued into the 1950s and later, leaving a mixture of successional forest regrowth. Since the 1970s, the site has been minimally managed to maintain access for recreational, educational and research goals.
Vegetation
The UNDERC property primarily includes second-growth Northern mesic forest with dominant species including, red and sugar maple (Acer rubrum and A. saccharum), aspen (Populus tremuloides and P. grandidentata) ) and paper birch (Betula papyrifera.). Evergreen forests are dominated by balsam fir (Abies balsamea) and may also include hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) and in the numerous wet areas, cedar (Thuja occidentalis) and black spruce (Picea mariana).
Poorly drained soils on the site can give rise to open, acidic sphagnum bogs dotted with tamarack (Larix laricina), black spruce and Ericaceous shrubs. Marshes surround numerous lakes including Crampton Lake, a co-located NEON aquatics site. Some wetlands are dominated by thickets of alder (Alnus incana subsp. rugosa).
Climate
Climate is generally humid, cool and wet with an annual average of 37.6º F at nearby Land O’ Lakes, WI with no true dry season. Temperature averages range from a low of -3.8º F and high of 49.7º F Annual precipitation is approximately 33 inches with 114 inches of snow.

At the SCBI, the forest was logged multiple times during the past 300 years and was managed mostly as farmland when acquired by the federal government in 1903. One reason that wildlands are found disproportionately in the mountain province of the domain is that the steep slopes and shallow soils are relatively unproductive for agriculture. Here too the site is typical of the domain, encompassing the full range of lithologic, edaphic, hydrologic, and biogeochemical conditions found in the Mid-Atlantic Domain.
Vegetation

Natural disturbances include late 19th century fire, beech scale-Nectria complex (beech bark disease) beginning in the 1940s, severe wind disturbance resulting from hurricanes in 1938 and 1954 and a damaging ice storm in 1998.

Site specific topics
Exogenous factors likely to affect forest growth and composition into the future include climate change, increasing regional rates of atmospheric deposition (S, N and Hg), and new invasive species, such as the hemlock wooly adelgid, emerald ash borer, and Asian long horned beetle, whose ranges are likely to expand within the region. Bartlett Experimental Forest also represents the most Northeastern NEON site, and anchors the top of the north-south nitrogen deposition gradient along the eastern-side of the US.
Vegetation
The Bartlett site is primarily Eastern Deciduous, boreal ecotone. Nearly all of the Bartlett Experimental Forest is now covered by high forest. The primary forest cover type is the sugar maple-beech-yellow birch type. The upper elevations support stands of spruce and fir. Softwoods such as hemlock, balsam fir and spruce are commonly mixed with hardwoods, especially on cool steep slopes or on the poorly drained soils at lower elevations. Although white pine occurs mostly in stands at lower elevations, scattered specimens can be found over a large part of the forest. The site provides the deciduous-to-boreal forest transitional ecotone towards the ecosystems in the North.

","5C/41F","490 mm","Emergent Herbaceous Wetlands, Grassland/Herbaceous","579 m","Site location description
The Northern Plains-Woodworth site is located at ~ 3 miles SE of the town of Woodworth, ND.  The Northern Plains-Woodworth site is part of the Chase Lake National Wildlife Refuge and is at the center of one of the largest roadless blocks of native prairie left in the Upper Great Plains.
Site history & management
This site has been restored to native vegetation, structure and function.
Site specific topics & science rationale
Woodworth provides a baseline understanding of a core wildland system that is historically representative of the region and provides meaningful comparison to the other sites in the region that are managed with different degrees of grazing intensity. While there is little urban development in the area, this site is paired with other grassland sites within the NEON continental design: it provides a contrast to sites that may receive chemical climate inputs from agronomic practices, as well as sites from nearby growing urban environments. The Woodworth site also provides an understanding of tall grass prairie environments and serves as a benchmark for detecting and exploring the causes and consequences of environmental change taking place throughout the grasslands of the Northern Plains Domain, with results relevant to semi-arid grassland ecosystems worldwide.  
Vegetation
Woodworth contains a mix of native grasslands, tame grasses and legumes with many species of wildflowers, and unique xeric (dry) mixed-grass prairies containing a plant community unique to North Dakota and the Great Plains. 
Biological conditions
Overall, the Northern Plains-Woodworth site retains most of the features representative of pre-settlement biotic and edaphic conditions, with large native herbivores. The Refuge and surrounding area also provides breeding and resting habitat for more than 293 bird species, and has been designated as one of America's Top 100 Globally Important Bird Areas (IBA) by the American Bird Conservancy.
Geology: 
Composing the Coleharbor Formation, river sediments (sand and gravel). Pleistocene and Holocene.
USGS HUC: h10160002
Dominant Phenology Species:
Poa pratensis, Bromus inermis, Artemisia absinthium
Mean Canopy Height:
